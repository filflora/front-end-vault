[Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/) is a JavaScript compiler.

Browsers are evolving differently. One thing is common: they understand plain old JavaScript.

Since front-end technologies are advancing and providing us newer ECMAScript and Typescript versions every year we need a compiler that transforms the new syntax to a backward compatible version.

Babel has different [plugins](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins) and [presets](https://babeljs.io/docs/presets) so we don't have to wait for browser support.
